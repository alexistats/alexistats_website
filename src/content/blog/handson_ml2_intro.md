Posts tagged with handson-ml2 refer to my reading and performing the exercises from the book "Hands On Machine Learning with Sickit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow, 2nd edition by Aurélien Géron".

These are not intended as tutorials, but to document my learning experience with the book. Whenever possible, I try to find a dataset different than the one the book use to force myself to get more experience playing with different datasets. Also, with the data being different, it forces me to be more "hands on" with the coding aspect, which is what I'm trying to work on.

Goal: Improve my familiarity with these python libraries and document my progress.
